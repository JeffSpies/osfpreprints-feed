# osfpreprints-feed

Code supporting an RSS feed to power Twitter feeds by OSF Preprint providers using IFTTT. For example,

http://osfreprints-feed.herokuapp.com/SocArXiv.rss

SocArXiv can be replaced by the canonical names/spellings of any of the OSF Preprint servers--it is case-sensitive unless the correct spelling has been hard-coded in main.py.

This repo includes the files necessary to run this on Heroku.
